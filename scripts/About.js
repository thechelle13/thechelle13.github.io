                <p>This static site was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deployed via GitHub Pages. The journey of production involved challenges, particularly in remembering the basics and understanding how each component communicates. These concepts are the foundations of modern technologies such as React.</p>
                <p>While React offers numerous benefits, such as component reusability and a more organized structure, getting back to the basics and understanding fundamental concepts was the goal of this exercise.</p>
                <p>Despite not utilizing React or other modern frameworks, this site aims to demonstrate the power of traditional web technologies through continuous practice and exploration.</p>
